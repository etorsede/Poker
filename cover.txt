Hello!

My name is Eric Torsede and I'm an engineer from Gothenburg, Sweden. Since I was around 15 years old, it has been a dream of mine to move to the USA, but not only to move there, but to work there as an engineer. This is the reason I'm applying for this position, to fulfill my dream and to work at one of the most interesting companies within the automotive area. I'm a as a person extremely curious and interested in all things regarding technology and engineering.

I like to see myself as a very ambitious person, and I view challenges as  a positive thing.
I enjoy interacting with people and work well in teams. So far I only lived in Sweden and worked at the same company for over 4 years. This is yet another reason for my interest in this career change.

I hope you will consider me as a candidate for this position. Please let me know if there's any additional information that I can provide. 

Best regards
Eric Torsede
